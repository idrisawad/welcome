My name is Idris Awad, but you may also know me as @Almost2Late. 
I am an IT security, AI, WEB3, and Blockchain enthusiast with a passion for Coding, Creating, Breaking, and Fixing things.

I have a diverse background, having worked as a tattoo artist, grayhat hacktivist, and a martial arts 剛柔流 sempai. My interests and skills have led me to explore the ever-evolving world of technology and security, and I am excited to share my projects and contributions with the community.
